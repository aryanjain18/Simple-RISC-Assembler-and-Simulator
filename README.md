TASK - Build an Assembler and Simulator for the given ISA

We created a splitter function which checked for all the errors and then we space splitted each line and then we used to assemble_out function to convert assembly code into binary machine code. We then created dictionaries for all the variables, labels  , commands, command lines etc. 
We also divided the total functions into a,,b,c,d,e,f type as given in procedure and implemented routines to convert their instructions into machine code. We also implemented file I/O to  take input from a text file and give output in final text file. 

errors.py - all the error functions that need to be handled and debugged have been implemented case by case in this file accordingly.

Final_SimpleAssembler.py - contains the final code for compilation and conversion of all type of instructions.

params.py - contains all the parameters for opcodes and register codes in the format of dictionary.

input_file.txt - is the input

machine_code_output.txt - contains the generated machine code.
