# RISC Assembler and Simulator

## Introduction

This project is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) assembler and simulator implemented in Python 3. The assembler component translates RISC instructions into their corresponding binary representation, while the simulator reverses this process by executing the binary instructions and maintaining the system's state.

## Features

### Assembler

The assembler takes human-readable RISC assembly code and converts it into machine-readable binary code. It supports a variety of RISC instructions and generates the corresponding binary output that can be executed by the simulator.

### Simulator

The simulator reads binary code generated by the assembler and executes the instructions, emulating the behavior of a RISC-based system. It keeps track of the system's state, including registers and memory, providing insights into the execution flow.

## Supported Instructions

The assembler and simulator support a basic set of RISC instructions, including but not limited to:

- Arithmetic instructions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Logic instructions (AND, OR, XOR)
- Memory instructions (load, store)
- Control flow instructions (jump, branch)

Refer to the documentation or comments in the source code for the complete list of supported instructions.
